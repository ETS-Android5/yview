TO DO list

- Restart icons.py while gui connected and session in device (line 308 MainFrame.java) is not connected.
- Timeout device that we've not heard from for some time.
- Get has PLANET_EARTH: {} in device dict
- setSelectedDevice in MainFrame.java. IF a terminal and web interface is available
  then display popup. Maybe this should be done when firing the event from the mouse listener ?
- Restart icons.py, wygs.py cannot connect to device even if java GUI is restarted
- Restart wygs.py, cannot connect to device unless java GUI is restarted
	    
	    
- Data flow
- processRXData() in ICONSConnection receives data from the ICONS
  this calls processLocation() in same file
  	this calls processDevice() in same file
  	  this then sends the device info to all listeners via deviceListener.setDevice(device);
  	
  MainFrame.java is the device listener and implements the setDevice() method
    In this method a tab is created if the location has not been heard from before.
    
    The deviceTablePanel.setDevice(device, groupName); is then called. In this method decisions 
    are taken about when to update or add a new device to the deviceVector (local to deviceTablePanel).
